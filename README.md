# Flutter Matrix Effect

A dynamic, interactive matrix effect visualisation built in Flutter. This project demonstrates smooth particle movement, inertia-based interactions, and user-configurable colours. Inspired by the classic "matrix rain" effect, this project visualises dots that are repelled from a touch location and return to their origin, creating a fluid and captivating animation.
